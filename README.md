# There are a few of the files I fiddle with uploaded here. 
They are excel files in binary form (.xlsb). I have edited them so they all have a custom menu/ribbon. The macros that are launched from the custom menu/ribbon make the tasks one usually performs with these easier.

# Files:
<!--
- [File to track users as they enter a venue](https://github.com/tzucker02/Excel_Files/blob/main/LT%20Brotherhood%20Breakfast%20Tracker.xlsb)
-->
- [File for teachers to make talking attendance and grading easier](https://github.com/tzucker02/Excel_Files/blob/main/Attendace%20and%20grading%20blank.xlsb)
